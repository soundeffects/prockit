# prockit
This set of crates constitute a **proc**edural tool**kit** for generating game and virtual
environment elements on the fly. These elements may include terrain, foliage, creatures, characters,
sounds, and more. If you want to add to that list, feel free to contribute!

`prockit` is tightly coupled and integrated with the Bevy game engine. 

This project is currently a WIP. Come back later for more!
