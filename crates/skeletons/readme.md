# prockit_skeletons
This crate defines the `Skeleton` and `Bone` components, which can have dynamic tree-shaped
topologies and from which meshes can be constructed at runtime. This creates a foundation for
procedurally generating trees, animals, and characters. It also allows for easy physics simulation
or animation of those objects by manipulating the underlying bone structure.

See the examples for usage, and the docs for more implementation details.
